              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>An Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is the group responsible for overseeing the
                  ethical use of animals in research within an institution. Under the&nbsp;<strong>Animal Welfare Act
                    and Regulations (AWAR)</strong>, every institution (e.g., a university or private research facility)
                  that uses animals for research must have an IACUC. An institution&rsquo;s IACUC serves as the internal
                  watchdog, ensuring that animal research conducted by the institution maintains the highest animal
                  welfare standards and that any proposed animal study is scientifically valid.</p>

              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>The primary responsibility of the IACUC is to review and approve animal research to ensure that all
                  projects involving the use of animals comply with the AWAR, and any additional regulations,
                  guidelines, and policies governing animal use. IACUCs are also responsible for monitoring their
                  respective animal facilities and animal care practices, reviewing incidents, and recommending
                  appropriate corrective actions. Other responsibilities of IACUCs include providing education and
                  training to researchers, staff, and students involved in animal research. Finally, IACUCs are
                  responsible for investigating any reports of animal welfare concerns or non-compliance.</p>

            <div>
              <h4 class="_lightText_h6ibl_47">External and Internal IACUCs</h4>
              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>To comply with the AWAR, research institutions can outsource their IACUC to a for-profit, external
                  contractor, or they can choose to form an internal IACUC composed primarily of employees of the
                  institution.</p>
                <p>While there can be advantages to utilizing an external IACUC, like being outside the
                  organization&rsquo;s direct compensation structure, there can also be significant disadvantages:
                  external IACUCs may lack adequate expertise in the organization&rsquo;s area of research, leading to
                  risks of duplicative or ill-designed studies; similarly, the committee members may not be experts in
                  animal welfare or the particular species selected for the study. External IACUCs are not free from
                  compensation-based conflicts of interest either, as the contract IACUC may be incentivized to vote in
                  the direction that favors the client organization (i.e., rubber-stamping protocols) to garner repeat
                  business.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, internal IACUCs allow for assembling committee members with a deep expertise in
                  the specific area of research being conducted and, therefore, allow for a more thorough review of the
                  justifications for animal use and extent to which the proposed research is appropriately refined.</p>

              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>At Neuralink, we opted to form our own internal IACUC rather than relying on an external one. Just as
                  internal IACUCs at academic institutions are comprised primarily of university employees (e.g.,
                  professors overseeing research labs), Neuralink&rsquo;s IACUC is comprised primarily of our employees.
                  Because Neuralink employs individuals from a diverse array of disciplines, including veterinarians,
                  animal welfare scientists, neuroscientists, surgeons, and engineers, our internal IACUC represents
                  both a broader range of perspectives and more depth than we would be able to achieve relying on an
                  external contractor to serve as our IACUC.</p>

                <p>At Neuralink, every single employee contributes to the company&rsquo;s success and, accordingly, all
                  full-time employees receive equity in the company. As a result, members of Neuralink&rsquo;s IACUC
                  hold equity in the company. This is typical of any company&rsquo;s IACUC. Members of Neuralink&rsquo;s
                  IACUC who are employees of the company do not receive additional compensation for their role on the
                  IACUC, and non-affiliated members, as is standard practice, are compensated only for the cost of lunch
                  and transportation to each meeting.</p>
                <p>Under the guidance and leadership of the IACUC Chair, Neuralink&rsquo;s IACUC fosters a culture of
                  transparency and robust consideration of dissenting opinions. The committee rigorously reviews each
                  protocol submission and only approves protocols when they satisfactorily safeguard animal welfare and
                  support high-quality scientific data. Indeed, this can be seen in how our IACUC has voted over the
                  past three years on protocols and amendments that were presented and reviewed at our monthly meetings.
