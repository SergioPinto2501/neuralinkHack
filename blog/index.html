                <p>In January, we conducted the first human implantation of our brain-computer interface (BCI). We were
                  able to detect the participant&rsquo;s neural signals shortly after the implantation surgery, and
                  since then, he has used our end-to-end BCI system for various applications, like playing online chess
                  and Sid Meier's Civilization VI*.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This marks a significant milestone towards making BCI technology available to potentially restore
                  autonomy to millions of people with unmet medical needs. We&rsquo;ve prepared this blog post to share
                  a high-level snapshot of where we are as a company: the mission that guides us, the technology we have
                  built, the study we are currently conducting, and the work we have yet to do.</p>

                <p>Our 3 R&rsquo;s blog series continues, this time highlighting the importance of the
                  <strong>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)</strong> and its role in promoting
                  <strong>R</strong>efinement, <strong>R</strong>eduction, and <strong>R</strong>eplacement at a
                  research facility. All animal research must be conducted in an ethical and humane manner. An
                  institution's IACUC provides oversight that is critical in achieving this requirement. In this blog
                  article, we explore the role and functions of Neuralink&rsquo;s IACUC.

For example, to optimize surgical outcomes, the preclinical team has created a pre-surgical workflow for evaluating implant fit on a personalized basis. The first step in this process is to collect computerized tomography (CT) data for a given animal pre-operatively. The animal&rsquo;s scan is then visualized using a computer program capable of loading both the CT scan and 3D models of our implants. With this software, engineers, surgeons, and veterinary staff can make measurements that evaluate implant fit, rotation, and fixation. Overall, this workflow refines our surgical procedure and ensures implantation success prior to surgery by eliminating intra-op implant placement decision-making and maximizing the precision of fit.&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The video below overviews an example of this pre-operative workflow.

Accordingly, our philosophy is to allow animals to safely and easily access their full range of natural species-typical behavior as a minimum obligation of animal caretakers. The goal of enrichment should instead be to exceed that basic care by offering a wide range of interesting ways to cognitively stimulate animals and to give them a variety of choices about how to engage in those behaviors.

Currently, all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans.

In 2017, we chose to partner with the University of California, Davis&rsquo;s prestigious California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC) to conduct animal based research. Over the next two and a half years we worked with the staff at UC Davis to establish the foundations of Neuralink&rsquo;s research and development mission.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When starting this type of medical research, novel surgeries are typically performed first in animal cadavers and then later in terminal procedures. Cadavers are deceased animals who have been humanely euthanized due to a veterinary decision for a medical concern or euthanized as part of a previous unrelated research study.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Terminal procedures involve the humane euthanasia of an anesthetized animal at the completion of the surgery. Animals that fall into this category have been deemed by the veterinary staff to be healthy enough for one anesthetic event but may not have proper quality of life due to a pre-existing condition. Performing initial surgeries on cadavers and terminal procedures ensures that an animal does not potentially suffer post-operatively in the event the test procedure has an unexpected result.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We therefore started our first studies at UC Davis using both cadavers and terminal procedures. These animals were assigned to our project on the day of the surgery for our terminal procedure because they had a wide range of pre-existing conditions unrelated to our research.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In addition to pre-existing conditions these animals may have happened to lose digits throughout their life from conflicts with other monkeys. Missing digits are often a result of rhesus macaques resolving conflict through aggressive interactions with one another.

Survival studies then allowed us to test the function of different generations of implanted devices as we refined them towards human use. The use of every animal was extensively planned and considered to balance scientific discovery with the ethical use of animals. As part of this work, two animals were euthanized at planned end dates to gather important histological data, and six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis. These reasons included one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue), one implant's connecting hardware became loose, and four suspected infections, a risk inherent with any percutaneous medical device.

Every 25 milliseconds, the Link transmits these spike counts over bluetooth to a computer running custom decoding software. First, this software re-aggregates the spike counts at several timescales, from the most recent 25 ms to the past 250 ms, to account for differing temporal properties in the activity of the motor neurons. Next, the weighted sum of these current and recent spike counts are computed for each dimension of control by passing their firing rates through a decoding model.

For example, for people with paralysis the Link could also potentially be used to restore physical mobility.
