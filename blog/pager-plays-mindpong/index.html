                    named Pager, to move a cursor on a computer screen with neural activity using a 1,024 electrode
                    <em>fully-implanted neural recording and data transmission device</em>, termed the N1 Link. We have
                    implanted the Link in the hand and arm areas of the motor cortex, a part of the brain that is
                    involved in planning and executing movements. We placed Links bilaterally: one in the left motor
                    cortex (which controls movements of the right side of the body) and another in the right motor
                    cortex (which controls the left side of the body).&nbsp;</p>
                  <p dir="auto">Neurons in somatosensory cortex respond to touch, and neurons in the visual cortex
                    respond to visual cues. Analogously, neurons in motor cortex modulate their activity prior to and
                    during movement, and are thought to be involved in planning, initiating and controlling voluntary
                    movements. Many neurons in motor cortex are directionally tuned, that is, more active for particular
                    movement directions than others. Different neurons are tuned to different movement directions. An
                    example of this directional modulation can be seen in the raster plot figure (Fig. 04).</p>

                    the direction and speed of an upcoming or intended movement. We can go further than simply
                    predicting the most likely intended movement given the current pattern of brain activity: we can use
                    these predictions to control, in real time, the movements of a computer cursor, or in the video
                    below, a MindPong paddle. The neurons with upward preferred directions clearly increase their firing
                    rates as the monkey moves his MindPong paddle upward, and the ones with downward preferred

                <p>The Link amplifies and digitizes the voltage recorded from each of its 1024 electrodes. These tiny
                  voltage traces contain signatures of the activity of nearby neurons (called action potentials or
                  &ldquo;spikes&rdquo;). Custom algorithms running aboard the Link automatically detect spikes on each
                  electrode, which are then aggregated into vectors of spike counts [1 count every 25 ms x 1024
                  channels]. Every 25 milliseconds, the Link transmits these spike counts over bluetooth to a computer
                  running custom decoding software. First, this software re-aggregates the spike counts at several
                  timescales, from the most recent 25 ms to the past 250 ms, to account for differing temporal
                  properties in the activity of the motor neurons. Next, the weighted sum of these current and recent
                  spike counts are computed for each dimension of control by passing their firing rates through a
                  decoding model. The output of the decoder is a set of velocity signals for each 25 ms bin, which are
                  integrated over time to direct the movement of a cursor (or MindPong paddle) on a computer screen.</p>

              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>With monkeys, we calibrate the decoder by mapping neural activity patterns to actual (joystick)
                  movements. However, we won't be able to use such a strategy for people with paralysis. Prior research
                  by the BrainGate consortium have shown that neurons in the motor cortex remain directionally tuned to
                  movement intention even in people with paralysis, and that it is possible to calibrate a decoder as
                  the person simply imagines moving a mouse on a mousepad or a finger on a trackpad to guide a cursor
                  that automatically moves to presented targets. After the decoder is calibrated, the person is able to
                  type emails and text messages, browse the web, or anything else that can be done with a computer, just
                  by thinking about how they want the cursor to move.</p>
                <p>Neuralink's technology builds on decades of research. The BCI systems used in previous studies have
                  no more than a few hundred electrodes, with connectors that pass through the skin, requiring a
                  technician or caregiver to "connect" the BCI. Our mission is to build a safe and effective clinical
                  BCI system that is wireless and fully implantable that users can operate by themselves and take
                  anywhere they go; to scale up the number of electrodes for better robustness and higher information
                  throughput; and to automate the implant surgery to make it as rapid and safe as possible. Recent
                  engineering advances in the field and new technologies developed at Neuralink are paving the way for
                  progress on each of these key technical hurdles.</p>
                <p>Our first goal is to give people with paralysis their digital freedom back: to communicate more
                  easily via text, to follow their curiosity on the web, to express their creativity through photography
                  and art, and, yes, to play video games. After that, we intend to use the Link to help improve the
                  lives of those with neurological disorders and disabilities in other ways. For example, for people
                  with paralysis the Link could also potentially be used to restore physical mobility. To achieve this,
                  we'd use the Link to read signals in the brain and use them to stimulate nerves and muscles in the
                  body, thereby allowing the person to once again control their own limbs.</p>
                <p>As you can see, MindPong is an initial demonstration of the potential capabilities of the N1 Link.
                  However, it's important to remember that it is a small slice of what our device is intended to
                  achieve. If you'd like to be a part of making a brighter future through neural devices, we'd love to
                  hear from you.</p>

                <p>To make Neuralink implants a reality, the robot is absolutely necessary on two fronts: first, the
                  threads are smaller than a human hair and cannot be grasped, manipulated, and accurately inserted by a
                  human surgeon. Doing this requires micron precision for the grasp, tens of microns of precision for
                  localizing and tracking the moving brain during insertion, and high speed in order to get hundreds of
                  threads in quickly. Second, scaling to hundreds of thousands then millions of patients means that not
                  only must the thread insertion be automated but also the planning and execution of the rest of the
                  surgery.</p>

                  access to high quality nutrition, socialization, and enriched spaces to perform species-specific
                  behaviors. For example, Pager lives with his best mate, Code. They enjoy swinging from their treehouse
                  and napping in their hammocks after an engaging gaming session. All of the behavioral tasks that Pager
                  and his friends participate in are voluntary, and trained using positive reinforcement. Pager&rsquo;s

Analogously, neurons in motor cortex modulate their activity prior to and during movement, and are thought to be involved in planning, initiating and controlling voluntary movements. Many neurons in motor cortex are directionally tuned, that is, more active for particular movement directions than others. Different neurons are tuned to different movement directions.

These tiny voltage traces contain signatures of the activity of nearby neurons (called action potentials or &ldquo;spikes&rdquo;). Custom algorithms running aboard the Link automatically detect spikes on each electrode, which are then aggregated into vectors of spike counts [1 count every 25 ms x 1024 channels]. Every 25 milliseconds, the Link transmits these spike counts over bluetooth to a computer running custom decoding software. First, this software re-aggregates the spike counts at several timescales, from the most recent 25 ms to the past 250 ms, to account for differing temporal properties in the activity of the motor neurons. Next, the weighted sum of these current and recent spike counts are computed for each dimension of control by passing their firing rates through a decoding model. The output of the decoder is a set of velocity signals for each 25 ms bin, which are integrated over time to direct the movement of a cursor (or MindPong paddle) on a computer screen.\u003c/p>","left_block":""}},{"type":"image_with_caption","fields":{"image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/NsWdbfs2Ql22xVWgqigS","figure_number":6,"caption":"Graphical representation of a BCI decoding pipeline.\n","image_alt":"Graphical representation of a BCI decoding pipeline.","caption_placement":"","max_width_px":""}},{"type":"text_block","fields":{"title":"","body":"\u003cp>The video below shows the spatial pattern of directional tuning on each of the electrodes in Pager&rsquo;s implant while playing a 2D target acquisition game.\u003c/p>","left_block":""}},{"type":"youtube_video","fields":{"video_id":"0qbIL66J0Fs","full_width":false,"autoplay_inline":true,"portrait":false,"figure_number":"7","caption":"\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tuning on Neuralink electrodes (watch until the end)\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Each circle represents one electrode.

Prior research by the BrainGate consortium have shown that neurons in the motor cortex remain directionally tuned to movement intention even in people with paralysis, and that it is possible to calibrate a decoder as the person simply imagines moving a mouse on a mousepad or a finger on a trackpad to guide a cursor that automatically moves to presented targets. After the decoder is calibrated, the person is able to type emails and text messages, browse the web, or anything else that can be done with a computer, just by thinking about how they want the cursor to move.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neuralink's technology builds on decades of research. The BCI systems used in previous studies have no more than a few hundred electrodes, with connectors that pass through the skin, requiring a technician or caregiver to \"connect\" the BCI. Our mission is to build a safe and effective clinical BCI system that is wireless and fully implantable that users can operate by themselves and take anywhere they go; to scale up the number of electrodes for better robustness and higher information throughput; and to automate the implant surgery to make it as rapid and safe as possible. Recent engineering advances in the field and new technologies developed at Neuralink are paving the way for progress on each of these key technical hurdles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our first goal is to give people with paralysis their digital freedom back: to communicate more easily via text, to follow their curiosity on the web, to express their creativity through photography and art, and, yes, to play video games. After that, we intend to use the Link to help improve the lives of those with neurological disorders and disabilities in other ways. For example, for people with paralysis the Link could also potentially be used to restore physical mobility. To achieve this, we'd use the Link to read signals in the brain and use them to stimulate nerves and muscles in the body, thereby allowing the person to once again control their own limbs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As you can see, MindPong is an initial demonstration of the potential capabilities of the N1 Link.
