                <p>Preclinical research, also called<strong> </strong><strong><em>nonclinical testing</em></strong>,
                  refers to the body of work and scientific studies that occur before any new product (device or drug)
                  is tested in humans (at &ldquo;the clinic&rdquo;). The <a
                    href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/5002/text">FDA Modernization Act
                    2.0</a> defines nonclinical testing as, &ldquo;a test conducted <em>in vitro</em>, <em>in
                    silico</em>, or <em>in chemico</em>, or a non-human <em>in vivo</em> test that occurs before or
                  during the clinical trial phase of the investigation of the safety and effectiveness of a drug, and
                  may include animal tests, or non-animal or human biology-based test methods, such as cell-based
                  assays, microphysiological systems, or bioprinted or computer models.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Generally, preclinical research can be split into two major categories:&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em> and
                  <em>in vivo</em>. All tests conducted in a controlled environment outside of a living organism (think
                  cell culture, test tubes, and lab bench work) are considered <em>in vitro</em> research &mdash; Latin
                  for &ldquo;within the glass.&rdquo; Any tests that are conducted within a living organism (plant,
                  animal, or human) are considered <em>in vivo</em> research &mdash; Latin for &ldquo;within the
                  living.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Bench studies are the first step taken towards evaluating a scientific or engineering idea. They
                    serve as a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; validation or rejection phase &mdash;&nbsp; focusing on
                    the basic mechanical, chemical, proxy, or <em>in vitro</em> tests in order to narrow down the

                  <p>Pilot studies are the second step in the preclinical research pipeline. These tests are iterative
                    and are performed in order to demonstrate that the new idea/method/design is compatible with the
                    current standard of practice, results in promising initial data, and is logistically feasible.</p>

                  <p>R&amp;D studies are the third step in this process and are critical to establishing readiness for
                    GLP. These studies are designed to fine-tune the study hypotheses, objectives, methods, and metrics.

                  <p>GLP studies are the final step in the preclinical research process and focus primarily on the
                    evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of a device and/or any new parts or materials that will
                    be in contact with patient tissue. GLP studies are conducted per the <a
                      href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=58">Code of

                    standard.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>These studies are precursors to clinical trials and the FDA approves preliminary clinical trials
                    based on the results from GLP studies. Because of this, companies are subject to inspections and
                    audits from the FDA to ensure compliance with these federal regulations.</p>

                      implantation of Neuralink devices into animals, and ultimately humans, is safe, effective, and
                      robust.</em></strong></p>
                <p>Currently, the team is composed of neuroscientists, neuro-engineers, biomedical engineers, and
                  veterinarians. Preclinical team conduct is guided by prioritizing two main tenets:&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Animal Welfare</li>
                  <li>Scientific Rigor</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Before any new study, method, procedure, or approach is initialized, the preclinical team works
                  alongside the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (<a
                    href="../the-role-of-the-institutional-animal-care-and-use-committee/index.html">IACUC</a>) to align
                  on best practices with regards to the welfare of the animal. Neuralink&rsquo;s IACUC has a multi-step
                  process to review, deliberate, and vote on study protocols and methods. Approval by the IACUC is
                  required prior to initiating any animal study at Neuralink.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The cross-functional collaboration at Neuralink between the preclinical, veterinary medicine, animal
                  care, pathology, engineering, IACUC, and surgical teams provides a balanced and fair perspective on
                  study design that then enables the team to develop the most comprehensive protocols possible.</p>
                <p>There is no single animal model that perfectly recapitulates human anatomy and physiology. We employ
                  a variety of models for different research purposes. Below you will find a table that outlines the
                  benefits and drawbacks of using each of our animal models. The model chosen for any specific study is
                  based on the objectives, a risk-benefit analysis, and the likelihood of representing the human
                  condition under study. Whenever possible, at the end of their research involvement, Neuralink will
                  seek&nbsp;<a href="../neuralink-s-commitment-to-animal-welfare/index.html">ethical retirement

                  <p>Pigs are well suited for studies that closely mimic the human condition in terms of brain size,

                    utilizing positive reinforcement, such as simple discrimination tasks and voluntary hoof trims. One
                    reason to consider an animal model other than swine is due to the biologically normal expansion of
                    the frontal sinuses over time, along with the rate and direction of skull growth.</p>

                  <p>Sheep are an excellent, non-primate representation of the human condition. Along with the rate of
                    their skull and neomembrane regrowth, sheep also have more natural brain motion than pigs, which
                    makes them the better model for representing surgical conditions in people. Sheep are also
                    conditioned to voluntarily participate in necessary husbandry and medical behaviors such as shearing
                    and stationing for veterinary assessments. One reason to consider an animal model other than sheep

                <h5>Accelerated Lifetime Testing (ALT)</h5>
                <p>ALT was developed as an <em>in vitro</em> method to help us expedite, predict, and capture how our N1
                  Implant will change in biological-like conditions over time (on the order of years) without actually
                  having to wait that long. ALT is carried out in a harsher environment than would be experienced <em>in
                    vivo</em>; at an elevated temperature and in the presence of reactive oxygen species to achieve a
                  conservatively estimated four-fold acceleration factor. N1 Implants in ALT are continuously monitored
                  via streaming diagnostic packets and charged wirelessly. The impedances of the electrodes are also
                  recorded to monitor the health of the threads. Altogether, this test allows prediction of N1 Implant
                  lifetime (including implant package and recording electrodes) on an accelerated time scale. Through
                  the development and implementation of ALT, we have been able to reduce our animal usage numbers and
                  more rapidly test the physical and mechanical limits of our devices.</p>
                <p>In the videos below, you can see how N1 Implants are first inserted into ALT testing cells with fluid
                  lines coming in and out of each testing cell. The cell is then loaded with fluid (artificial
                  cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) and hooked into the testing system via a drawer on the server rack, after
                  which the system can circulate its fluid and record live diagnostics until the device fails. Each
                  drawer in the server rack can hold 20 devices, and each server rack can accommodate up to 20 drawers,
                  allowing for simultaneous testing of 400 devices for each ALT system.</p>

                <h5>Brain Proxy Development &amp; Testing</h5>
                <p>Neuralink engineers have worked to develop groundbreaking proxies for bench testing, with the goal of
                  eventually replacing the need to test new designs in animals. These proxies will also allow our
                  surgical personnel to practice N1 implantation procedures on anatomically realistic models of human
                  and animal heads. In order to mimic the physical properties of the brain, there were four main
                  structural components that we wanted to maintain in our surgical proxy:&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Material that models the anatomical topography of the brain's ridges and grooves, known as gyri
                    and sulci. These materials should preferably have mechanical properties similar enough to the
                    neuronal and glial parenchyma of the brain, allowing us to practice inserting N1 threads.</li>
                  <li>Superficial layers that mimic the brain&rsquo;s three protective meningeal membranes, known as the
                    dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater.</li>
                  <li>Material mimicking the intricate vasculature on the cortical surface.</li>
                  <li>The slow, periodic, pulsatile movements of the brain caused by breathing and heart rate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Neuralink engineers tackled the first challenge by developing a method to translate real human MRI
                  scans into 3D hydrogel molds of a patient&rsquo;s characteristic gyri and sulci, clearing a path
                  forward for our surgeons to eventually practice implantation in proxies that approximate a
                  patient&rsquo;s unique brain anatomy.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To model the brain&rsquo;s meningeal layers, our engineers are working to create substitutes with
                  mechanical properties approximating the brain&rsquo;s tough, leathery, outer dural layer, the
                  intermediate web-like cavernous arachnoid layer, and the thin, delicate, innermost layer known as the
                  pia mater.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The meninges do more than protect the brain, however, as they house a complex network of delicate
                  vasculature responsible for nourishing and oxygenating the brain&rsquo;s parenchymal tissues. This
                  motivated our engineers to include both 2D and 3D printed models of arteries and veins on the
                  proxy&rsquo;s surface, allowing our surgeons and robot operators to practice intraoperative vessel
                  avoidance strategies that are of critical importance to patient outcomes. To add yet another layer of
                  intraoperative realism, our engineers developed a proxy holder that would pulse roughly 1.5 times a
                  second, matching the periodic cardiovascular-induced motions of the brain.</p>
                <p>In the video below you can see our realistic head, skull, and brain proxies in action, all modeled
                  after the anatomy of a Neuralink Principal Investigator, Dan Adams. Each component of the proxy system
                  is used to practice critical elements of our surgical implantation workflow. Our surgical proxy system
                  can be used to practice neuronavigation targeting based on CT and MRI scans, incisions can be made on
                  the scalp of the head proxy, craniectomies can be drilled into the skull proxy, and N1 threads can be
                  inserted into the brain proxy.</p>

                <p>The end result is an impressively realistic surgical proxy system that can replace some animal usage
                  in research at Neuralink. While modern day proxies continue to evolve and provide more opportunities
                  to reduce animal numbers in research, the way mature cells (micro) react to implantation and how this
                  develops over time within an entire organ or system (macro) is not currently wholly reproducible in a
                  proxy. Regardless, Neuralink is continuing to make progress towards this ultimate goal.</p>

                <h5>Personalized Implant Fit</h5>
                <p>When proxies and bench top testing are exhausted, extreme effort is poured into the third
                  &ldquo;R&rdquo; &mdash; refinement. For example, to optimize surgical outcomes, the preclinical team
                  has created a pre-surgical workflow for evaluating implant fit on a personalized basis. The first step
                  in this process is to collect computerized tomography (CT) data for a given animal pre-operatively.
                  The animal&rsquo;s scan is then visualized using a computer program capable of loading both the CT
                  scan and 3D models of our implants. With this software, engineers, surgeons, and veterinary staff can
                  make measurements that evaluate implant fit, rotation, and fixation. Overall, this workflow refines
                  our surgical procedure and ensures implantation success prior to surgery by eliminating intra-op
                  implant placement decision-making and maximizing the precision of fit.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The video below overviews an example of this pre-operative workflow. First, a given animal&rsquo;s
                  scan is loaded into CT software and 3D rendered alongside models of our N1 Implant. Using custom
                  software, the implants are then placed in the optimal skull position such that adequate implant
                  fixation can be achieved.&nbsp;</p>

To add yet another layer of intraoperative realism, our engineers developed a proxy holder that would pulse roughly 1.5 times a second, matching the periodic cardiovascular-induced motions of the brain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the video below you can see our realistic head, skull, and brain proxies in action, all modeled after the anatomy of a Neuralink Principal Investigator, Dan Adams.
