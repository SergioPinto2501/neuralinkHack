                <p>While well-being is a qualitative experience, and thus, difficult to measure, we can
                  use&nbsp;<strong>first principles</strong>&nbsp;to build upon our fundamental knowledge. The smallest
                  unit of absolute known truth in a subjective condition, such as personal well-being, are the
                  categories of experiences an animal has throughout their day. For an animal participating in medical
                  research, we review seven categories of their daily experience, as shown in the diagram below:</p>

                  <li>Do they have access to<span style="color: rgb(194, 224, 244);">&nbsp;<span

                          style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?</span></span></span></li>
                  <li>Do they have access to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(224, 62, 45);"><strong>species-typical
                        behaviors</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?</span></span></li>
                  <li>Do they have access to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(45, 194, 107);"><strong>agency</strong><span
                        style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?</span></span></li>
                  <li>Do they have access to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(241, 196, 15);"><strong>joy</strong><span
                        style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?</span></span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We define the primary terms in these questions as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><span style="color: rgb(53, 152, 219);"><strong>Basic Needs</strong></span>&nbsp;are the
                    fundamental requirements required for animals to thrive in their environment including access to
                    food, water, and shelter.</li>
                  <li><span style="color: rgb(224, 62, 45);"><strong>Species-Typical Behaviors</strong></span>&nbsp;are
                    behaviors that are typically shared by all members of the same species and are a product of the
                    brainstem, implying that they are strongly influenced by evolution.</li>
                  <li><span style="color: rgb(45, 194, 107);"><strong>Agency</strong></span>&nbsp;refers to the feeling
                    of control over actions and their consequences. Controlling different aspects of our lives can help
                    us feel safe and motivated. Ensuring the choices we offer to animals are&nbsp;<strong>truly
                      voluntary, including the opportunities to change their minds</strong>&nbsp;about those choices is
                    one way we can ensure access to agency.</li>
                  <li><span style="color: rgb(241, 196, 15);"><strong>Joy</strong></span>&nbsp;is defined generally as
                    great happiness or pleasure, which is difficult to measure quantitatively. We therefore look at the
                    behaviors most associated with this state and note those frequencies exist most often when an animal
                    has&nbsp;<strong>access to their most preferred activities</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As an example, when we assessed the well-being of our three animal species under the category of
                  HOUSING, we identified a gap in our sheep housing:</p>

                  flock and hop at a frequency comparable to animals in their natural environment. However, grazing
                  behavior was not readily met in the barn and corrals under the definition in our

                  them with a grass pasture, in addition to their barn and corral. Sheep are also considered a prey
                  species, which means we need to provide substantial security, such as fencing and shelters, to protect
                  them from predators.&nbsp;<strong>Fig. 5</strong></p>

                  environment to do so. We also observed our sheep standing at the gate to return to the barn when
                  temperatures rose throughout the day. From these data collection sessions and observations, we learned
                  their preference to be outdoors in the mornings and a strong preference to return to their air

                <p>Comfortable housing for sheep, therefore, includes a variety of environments for them to choose from.
                  As a result of our well-being assessment, in addition to the existing air-conditioned/heated barns
                  with bedded stalls and protected outdoor corrals, we added a protected outdoor pasture with shelters
                  to help satisfy the behavioral needs of the sheep.</p>
                <p>The next step to continue our well-being assessment is asking our four questions in the next
                  categories - food and water. As shown in the assessment tables, we previously found gaps in providing

                <p>Everyone has the right to&nbsp;<strong>basic needs</strong>. Access to a healthy diet, clean water,
                  and protective yet comfortable housing is an absolute minimum. Our team of veterinarians designed
                  diverse, healthy diets and helped our behavior team identify ways to deliver those diets in

                <p>Novel foraging devices and environments allow us to stimulate cognition while accessing
                  species-typical behaviors. For example, some species may prefer using water lixits over drinking from
                  water pools, depending on what is most comfortable to them. Another example is that foragers need to
                  perform more fine motor hand movements to pluck leaves or peel fruits, while grazers need to stroll
                  long distances as they trim the grass.&nbsp;<strong>Fig. 10</strong></p>

                <p>By providing not just access to water and daily calories but also delivering them through engaging,
                  species appropriate methods, we can successfully check off both questions #1 - Basic Needs and #2 -
                  Species-Typical Behaviors under the categories of food and water. Notably, we are absolutely against
                  any food or water restrictions as a behavioral motivation strategy and do not engage in the practice.

                <p>One exciting enrichment initiative we introduced this year to help us with this challenge was
                  communication buttons and icons, which allows the animals to share their preferences with us. These
