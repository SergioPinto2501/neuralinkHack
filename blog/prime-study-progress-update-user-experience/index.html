                <p><a href="https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/public/Facts%20and%20Figures%202024%20-%20Final.pdf"
                    rel="follow noopener" target="_blank">It is estimated</a> that 180,000 Americans live with
                  quadriplegia, and each year, an additional ~18,000 suffer a paralyzing spinal cord injury. We live in
                  a digital society where‬‭ much of our work, entertainment, and social lives rely heavily on our use of
                  computers and‬‭ smart devices. People with quadriplegia often find that their needs to engage
                  seamlessly with the digital world go unmet, leading to decreased independence, isolation, and
                  financial challenges. Our goal is to provide a high-performance interface that will enhance the
                  control of digital devices for people with quadriplegia, unlocking their personal and professional
                  potential.</p>
                <p>The first step toward this goal was achieved just over 100 days ago at <a
                    href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank">Barrow Neurological
                    Institute</a> in Phoenix Arizona, where Noland Arbaugh, the first participant of the PRIME Study*,
                  received his Neuralink implant (Link). As noted in <a href="../prime-study-progress-update/index.html"
                    rel="follow noopener" target="_blank">our last blog post</a>, the surgery went extremely well, and
                  he was able to go home the following day.</p>
                <p>The aim of the PRIME Study is to demonstrate that the Link is safe and useful in daily life. We will
                  monitor its technical performance remotely and quantify any benefit it provides by timing the duration
                  of independent use and assessing how it affects study participants&rsquo; quality of life.</p>

                <p>Prior to having the Link, Noland&rsquo;s primary digital interface was a mouth-held tablet stylus
                  (mouth stick) that had to be put in place by a caregiver. The mouth stick can only be used in the
                  upright position to operate a tablet. With prolonged use it can lead to discomfort, muscle fatigue,
                  and pressure sores; it also prevents normal speech.</p>

                  by controlling a cursor with his mind. He has even used the Link to play Mario Kart on a Nintendo

                <p>Participation in research sessions allows us to evaluate the performance of the Link. The standard
                  measure for speed and accuracy of cursor control is bits-per-second (BPS), calculated using a grid
                  task (Fig 03). Higher BPS values indicate better cursor control. During his first-ever research
                  session, Noland set a new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28220753/" rel="follow noopener"
                    target="_blank">world record</a> for human BCI cursor control of 4.6 BPS. He has subsequently
                  achieved 8.0 BPS and is currently trying to beat scores of the Neuralink engineers using a mouse (~10
                  BPS). The Link is able to distinguish left and right clicks and allows cursor control sufficiently
                  precise to select targets similar in size to the smallest icons and buttons on a laptop screen (Fig
                  03). The ability to select small targets using multiple click types allows Noland to use applications
                  and play games on his laptop that were not possible with his mouth stick.</p>

This led to a reduction in BPS (Fig 04). In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface. These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS, that has now superseded Noland&rsquo;s initial performance.\u003c/p>","left_block":""}},{"type":"image_with_caption","fields":{"image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/Yph4AsCHSYuz9iMI6ehQ","figure_number":4,"caption":"Daily peak performance in bits per second (BPS).","image_alt":"A bar chart labeled \"Daily peak BCI performance.\" The BPS raises from 4 to 8 over the first couple of days, drops to 2 over a couple more days, and then crawls back up until it's consistency around 8.","caption_placement":"down","max_width_px":""}},{"type":"text_block","fields":{"title":"","body":"\u003cp>Our current work is focused on pushing cursor control performance to the same level as that of able-bodied individuals, and on expanding functionality to include text entry.
