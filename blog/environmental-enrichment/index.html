                <p>With an understanding of what environmental enrichment means, let&rsquo;s dive into how we ensure we
                  are providing sufficient environmental enrichment.</p>
                <p>Considered the father of environmental enrichment, Dr. Hal Markowitz dedicated his life to creating
                  environments that empower animals to control their own feeding schedules. Dr. Markowitz emphasized
                  that clear goals, along with rigorous data collection, are essential to gauging efficacy of enrichment
                  programs (<a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Canine-Enrichment-Real-World-Making/dp/1617812684/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2BI7ECDWB4PPN&amp;keywords=enrichment+for+the+real+world+bender+and+strong&amp;qid=1678974559&amp;sprefix=enrichment+for+the+real+world+bender+and+strong%2Caps%2C96&amp;sr=8-1"
                    rel="follow">Bender and Strong 2019</a>).</p>
                <p>Using Dr. Markowitz&rsquo;s methodology, we approach our enrichment program through a first
                  principles lens by comparing our animals&rsquo; time spent in each activity with their counterparts in
                  the wild. We call these changes in behavioral states that an individual makes throughout the day
                  &ldquo;activity budgets&rdquo;. From there, we can identify any behavioral differences between an
                  animal in our care and those in the wild and provide enrichment that satisfies those essential
                  species-typical behaviors. He believed ethograms - tables that define a list of behaviors that a
                  particular animal species displays - should be used to guide zoos&rsquo; enrichment plans.</p>

              <div class="_text-md_h6ibl_63">
                <p>Traditionally, in the animal care industry - especially animals in a captive environment such as
                  zoos, sanctuaries, and laboratory facilities - enrichment is used to decrease stereotypies, or
                  abnormal behaviors. However, the presence of abnormal behaviors indicates that something may be
                  lacking in an animal&rsquo;s environment, as wild animals in their fully enriched natural habitat do
                  not typically exhibit abnormal behaviors. Accordingly, our philosophy is to allow animals to safely
                  and easily access their full range of natural species-typical behavior as a minimum obligation of
                  animal caretakers. The goal of enrichment should instead be to exceed that basic care by offering a
                  wide range of interesting ways to cognitively stimulate animals and to give them a variety of choices
                  about how to engage in those behaviors. Figures 1-3 show examples of structural enrichment and
                  foraging devices used to maximize cognitive stimulation throughout our animals&rsquo; day.</p>
                <p>Since Dr. Markowitz&rsquo; early work in this field, enrichment programs across the country have
                  developed frameworks based on his original teachings. At Neuralink, we adopted Disney&rsquo;s Animal
                  Kingdom&nbsp;<a href="http://www.animalenrichment.org/spider">S.P.I.D.E.R. framework</a>&nbsp;to
                  determine enrichment needs in our facilities. We chose the S.P.I.D.E.R. framework because it organizes
                  the process in a coherent, first principles fashion, and highlights the importance of species-typical
                  as well as individual behavioral needs as the fundamental guide to enrichment development.</p>
                <p>Below, we go through an example of how we used the S.P.I.D.E.R. framework to target increased resting
                  behavior in Rhesus macaques. As shown in Fig. 4, our macaques demonstrate comparable results to their
                  wild counterparts in the amount of time they rest throughout their 12 hour day.</p>

                <p>To identify behaviors to promote through environmental enrichment in our Rhesus macaques, we looked
                  at the activity budget of their wild counterparts. We learned that wild macaques spend about one-third
                  of their day resting and wanted our animals to have similar resting patterns when designing our
                  vivarium. To accurately compare the activity budget of our animals versus their wild conspecifics
                  observed in Fig. 5, we started by using the same ethogram definition of resting that Jaman &amp;
                  Huffman used for wild counterparts (Fig. 6). This allowed us to confirm that our animals' average time
                  resting closely matched that of wild counterparts under the definition used by wildlife scientists.
                  However, it made us wonder if the definition afforded our animals enough quality of rest. Thus, we

                <p>Once we determined the species-typical behaviors we wish to promote (quality rest), we considered
                  potential safety concerns, resources needed to access these behaviors, and where/ when the enrichment
                  will take place. We determined that we needed to give animals plenty of space to interact safely with
                  a conspecific and also provide highly desirable resting spots. We also needed to ensure animals felt
                  comfortable enough to fully relax.</p>
                <p>We started by researching what a relaxing environment for a macaque might look like in a natural
                  environment. Resting areas for Rhesus macaques in the wild are usually either on the ground or up in
                  trees depending on whether predators are present in the environment. Macaques typically take shelter
                  at higher altitudes in the colder months and lower altitudes during warmer months to minimize energy
                  expended through thermoregulation. They also tend to rest in grasslands, on rocks or fallen trees, and
                  nearby forage patches where they last foraged for resources each day (<a

                  fabric-based hammocks such as the one shown in Fig. 7. Our goal was to create a comfortable sleeping
                  environment that would withstand the strength and curiosity of a macaque in addition to more closely
                  mimicking materials they sleep on in the wild.</p>

                <p>For the next step, we created an enrichment schedule that focused on animals receiving structural
                  enrichment in their homes that support the performance of species-typical behaviors such as foraging,
                  object manipulation, moving, and resting. Because the key to enrichment is novelty, we rotate these
                  structures regularly to diversify the animals&rsquo; environment. Through our icon program described
                  in a recent&nbsp;<a href="../husbandry-refinement/index.html" rel="follow">blog post</a>, our animals
                  can exercise agency by also selecting their preferred structural enrichment.</p>
                <p>To specifically encourage resting, we incorporated a number of different hammocks, buckets, perches,
                  swings, and tires that give animals plenty of choice of where to snuggle up and take a nap.
                  We&rsquo;ve also experimented with various foraging substrates to incorporate more nesting material
                  that increases comfort (Fig. 8 - 10).</p>

                <p><br>In January, an animal caretaker submitted the idea to use wood wool as a nesting material for our
                  Rhesus macaques (Fig. 11). After the item was assessed and approved, we documented engagement levels
                  to make sure the novel enrichment truly met our cognitive engagement goals, targeted the desired
                  behavior, and posed no health / safety risks for the animal (Fig. 12).</p>
                <p>The importance of continuously evaluating environmental enrichment is highlighted in the book Canine
                  Enrichment for the Real World by Allie Bender and Emily Strong. In the book, the authors discuss Dr.
                  Markowitz&rsquo; thoughts on the impact of confirming that the intended enrichment is in fact

                  enrichment is about quantifiably improving the quality of life of captive and domesticated animals,
                  which means that it isn&rsquo;t enough for enrichment to look good or feel good to us. Enrichment

                  up to our drainage system, and shows positive engagement. We also observed our macaques making nests
                  with it. For these reasons, the new enrichment passed with flying colors. Now that the evaluation
                  period is complete, we&rsquo;ve added wood wool to our regular enrichment rotation, helping to fill
                  that necessary gap to target increased amounts of resting behavior.</p>
                <p>To make sure we&rsquo;ve actually met our goal of increasing the amount of time our macaques spend
                  resting throughout the day, we conducted behavior scans on our primates using the definition found on
                  the ethogram in Fig. 6. Using behavior scans, we can reliably ascertain information about their
                  resting patterns. With this data, we found that our animals spend about 25.5% of their day time
                  resting (Fig. 4).</p>

                  more insight on the quality of their rest throughout the day.</p>

                  may not truly be relaxed, we modified our definition of resting to the one in the table below (Fig.
                  13). Because we can&rsquo;t tell whether animals are truly sleeping without more invasive
                  interventions, our updated definition of resting includes the animal having their head down and/ or
                  eyes closed to indicate that they were likely napping.</p>

                <p>Environmental enrichment helps us fill gaps identified in our well-being assessments. Increasing our
                  total resting behavior duration is just one example of how we&rsquo;ve used this S.P.I.D.E.R.
                  framework. Utilizing this process, we&rsquo;ve developed a supplemental enrichment program that
                  encourages animals to increase performance of various species-typical behaviors throughout the week
                  (Fig. 17).</p>
                <p>We will continue to expand this program as we find more opportunities to enrich the lives of our
                  animals each day. The S.P.I.D.E.R. framework allows us to think critically about future housing
                  features that promote natural behaviors of each of the species living in our care. Stay tuned for our
                  upcoming Refinement blog posts, where we&rsquo;ll discuss how we motivate our animals to voluntarily
                  participate in husbandry, veterinary medicine, and research behaviors through our animal training and

From there, we can identify any behavioral differences between an animal in our care and those in the wild and provide enrichment that satisfies those essential species-typical behaviors.

However, the presence of abnormal behaviors indicates that something may be lacking in an animal&rsquo;s environment, as wild animals in their fully enriched natural habitat do not typically exhibit abnormal behaviors. Accordingly, our philosophy is to allow animals to safely and easily access their full range of natural species-typical behavior as a minimum obligation of animal caretakers. The goal of enrichment should instead be to exceed that basic care by offering a wide range of interesting ways to cognitively stimulate animals and to give them a variety of choices about how to engage in those behaviors.
