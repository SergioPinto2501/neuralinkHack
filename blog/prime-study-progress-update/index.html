                    target="_blank">In January</a>, we conducted the first human implantation of our brain-computer
                  interface (BCI). We were able to detect the participant&rsquo;s neural signals shortly after the
                  implantation surgery, and since then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzNHxC96rDE"

                  applications, like playing online chess and Sid Meier's Civilization VI*.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This marks a significant milestone towards making BCI technology available to potentially restore
                  autonomy to millions of people with unmet medical needs. We&rsquo;ve prepared this blog post to share
                  a high-level snapshot of where we are as a company: the mission that guides us, the technology we have
                  built, the study we are currently conducting, and the work we have yet to do.</p>

                  brain. In service of this long term goal, we have spent the last several years building a device
                  intended to interface with various regions of the brain to solve debilitating brain and central
                  nervous system ailments. The first indication we aim to address is the restoration of digital autonomy

                <h5>What we&rsquo;ve built</h5>
                <p>The current version of the device &mdash; the N1 Implant &mdash; is an intracortical BCI implant
                  designed to record neural activity through 1,024 electrodes distributed across 64 flexible leads, or
                  &ldquo;threads,&rdquo; each of which are thinner than a human hair and capable of being placed
                  independently in the brain.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>While the thin and flexible nature of the threads are designed to decrease participant risk and
                  increase device utility, they also make the threads impractical to manipulate by hand. Therefore,
                  we&rsquo;ve built a surgical robot &mdash; the R1 Robot &mdash; designed to reliably and efficiently
                  insert the threads into the cortex, so that the electrodes can be placed near neurons of interest.</p>

                <p>Signals acquired by the electrodes are routed to electronics contained in the enclosure of the N1
                  Implant, which process and wirelessly transmit the neural data to an instance of the Neuralink
                  Application running on an external device, such as a computer. The Neuralink Application decodes and
                  translates the neural data into actions, such as movements of a cursor on a computer screen. The N1
                  Implant is powered by an onboard battery that is inductively recharged by the N1 Charger. The ability
                  to wirelessly communicate and inductively charge enables the N1 Implant to be surgically implanted
                  under the scalp so that it is cosmetically invisible and used without any physical connectors to
                  external devices.</p>

                    rel="follow noopener" target="_blank">Barrow Neurological Institute</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. The
                  surgery went extremely well, and the participant was able to go home the following day. The
                  participant&rsquo;s recovery since the surgery has been very smooth.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We chose to partner with Barrow based on their extensive expertise in caring for patients with
                  complex neurological conditions. With more than 300 active clinical trials currently underway, Barrow
                  is committed to advancing the field of neuroscience and ensuring patients have access to an array of
                  innovative treatment options and the most advanced and compassionate care.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/person/michael-lawton-md/"
                    rel="follow noopener" target="_blank">Michael T. Lawton, MD</a>, president and CEO of Barrow
                  Neurological Institute, &ldquo;This operation is an impressive engineering feat and an important
                  advancement in neurosurgery because it paves the way for new, non-biological treatments for patients
                  with severe neurological impairments. The PRIME Study will likely be viewed as ushering in an era of
                  brain-computer interface, or direct interaction between thoughts and implantable technology.&rdquo;

                  Barrow Neurological Institute and the principal investigator at Barrow for the PRIME Study, said,
                  &ldquo;Barrow is dedicated to improving the quality of life of our patients and we are proud to be
                  part of this landmark research that leverages novel medical and BCI technologies to potentially impact
                  the lives of people with quadriplegia in a profound way.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>In advance of the procedure, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed to
                  pin-point regions of the participant&rsquo;s brain that are active when they attempt to move their
                  hand and arm. The fMRI data were used to locate the target zone on the participant&rsquo;s precentral
                  gyrus, a cortical region associated with executing hand movements.</p>

                <p>At a high level, the surgery involved a neurosurgeon exposing the target region of the cortex (e.g.,
                  scalp incision, craniectomy, durectomy), the R1 Robot performing the insertions of threads of the N1
                  Implant, and the neurosurgeon mounting the body of the N1 Implant in the craniectomy and closing the
                  scalp.</p>
                <p>Approximately 18,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury each year in the United States. And, it's
                  estimated that 302,000 people living in the United States have experienced a traumatic spinal cord
                  injury.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;When an injury occurs to the brain or spinal cord, it can disrupt the normal functioning of
                  the entire nervous system. This can affect a person&rsquo;s ability to perform everyday tasks. We
                  remain hopeful that a BCI device may enable a digital bridge between the brain and spinal cord to
                  potentially improve the quality of life for people with severe spinal cord injuries,&rdquo;
