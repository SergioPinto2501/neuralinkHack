            <h2>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p><strong>Informal Process First</strong>. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and
                Neuralink, you will first contact Neuralink in writing at <a tabindex="0"
                  href="mailto:termsofuse@neuralink.com"
                  class="arrowLink _link_ptmou_11 _normal_ptmou_56 _black_ptmou_80"><span
                    class="_underlined_ptmou_32">termsofuse@neuralink.com</span></a> and make a good faith sustained
                effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without
                limitation, any arbitration or court action.</p>
              <p><strong>Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong>. If your dispute remains unresolved
                thirty (30) days after you first contact Neuralink, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim
                (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of the Website will be resolved by arbitration,
                including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and Neuralink agree that any Claim will
                be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its
                Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed
                to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). The JAMS Rules
                and the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, the latter effective July 15, 2009, are available
                at <a tabindex="0" href="https://jamsadr.com"
                  class="arrowLink _link_ptmou_11 _normal_ptmou_56 _black_ptmou_80"><span
                    class="_underlined_ptmou_32">https://jamsadr.com</span></a>. Arbitration will be handled by a sole,
                neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered
                in any court that has jurisdiction. You have a right to have the arbitration conducted via telephone, or
                as an in-person hearing in your hometown area (if you live in the United States) or another location
                that is reasonably convenient to you. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual
                basis – class, consolidated or representative arbitrations and class, consolidated or representative
                actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and Neuralink are each
                waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class, consolidated or representative action
                or class, consolidated or representative arbitration. Court review of an arbitration award is limited.
                The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
                (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages). The place of arbitration will be
                San Francisco, California, but if you prefer a hearing in or closer to your hometown area, you and
                Neuralink will confer in good faith in order to identify a reasonable alternative location. Each of the
                parties shall cooperate in good faith in the discovery or exchange of nonprivileged information relevant
                to the dispute as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a
                written statement stating the disposition of each claim, and the award will also provide a concise
                written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. You and
                Neuralink shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including
                the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits,
                or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a
                judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement or unless otherwise required by law or judicial
                decision.</p>
              <p><strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>. Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative
                and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the JAMS Rules and the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum
                Standards. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, Neuralink will pay for the reasonable
                filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds
                that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper
                purpose.</p>
              <p><strong>Opt-Out</strong>. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and waiver
                of class provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt- out to
                <a tabindex="0" href="mailto:termsofuse@neuralink.com"

                you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms, and the notice must specify
                your name and mailing address. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Neuralink also will not
                be bound by them.</p>
              <p><strong>Exceptions</strong>. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, you and Neuralink
                will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other
                equitable or conservatory relief, or if the Claim relates to intellectual property infringement or
                misappropriation, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</p>
