              <p>We may provide additional privacy notices to individuals at the time we collect their personal

                authorization forms. Also, the informed consent form to participate in the Neuralink Patient Registry
                describes our privacy practices with respect to personal information collected as part of the Neuralink
                Patient Registry. This type of an “in-time” notice will govern how we may process the personal
                information you provide at that time.</p>
              <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “<em><strong>Last Updated</strong></em>” date
                at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will

                    used by us and our service providers to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the
                    popularity of certain content, deliver content targeted to your interests on our Website,
                    troubleshoot issues with and improve the operation of our Website, and better understand your online

                  <p>Most browsers let you remove and/or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this,
                    follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, the
                    Website may not function properly.</p>
                  <p>We also use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users

                    Website. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve the Website. The reports

            <div class="section-content">
              <p><em><strong>Consent.</strong></em> We collect, use, and disclose your personal information with your
                consent or as permitted or required by law. How we obtain your consent, including whether it is express
                or implied, will depend on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal information in
                question. Generally, we will seek your consent at the time we collect your personal information, either
                orally, electronically, or in writing. If you provide personal information about another individual to
                us, it is your responsibility to obtain the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use and
                disclose their information.</p>
              <p>If you wish to withdraw your consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information,
                please contact us using the contact information below. We will accommodate your request to withdraw
                consent, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and as required by applicable laws. Withdrawal of
                your consent may mean that we will no longer be able to provide you with certain services.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Unsubscribe from communications.</strong></em> If you do not want to receive communications
                from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out by following the instructions in the relevant
                electronic communication or by contacting us using the contact information provided below. We will try
                to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out of
                receiving communications from us, we may still send you important communications such as administrative
                messages, which you cannot opt-out of.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Access your personal information.</strong></em> You may make a request to review any
                personal information about you that we have collected, used, or disclosed, by contacting us using the
                contact information provided below. We will provide you with any such personal information to the extent
                required by applicable laws.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Update or correct your personal information.</strong></em> In the event we collect personal
                information directly from you we will rely on the personal information you provide, so it is important
                that this information be accurate and up-to-date. If your personal information changes, or if you become
                aware that the personal information we maintain about you is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading,
                irrelevant or out of date, you may contact us using the contact information provided below. If you
                demonstrate that your personal information in our records is inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend
